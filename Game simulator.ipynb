    "Scoring runs are expected in any contest just by chance. This can easily be seen from simple coin flips. If a team is expected to convert 50% of possessions (equivalent to a coin flip), then they can be expected to convert several in a row while the other team converts none. In this way, scoring runs should be expected in most basketabll contests. I believe that far too much emphasis is placed on \"momentum\", and players should be expected to recognize these \"slumps\" and \"streaks\" as statistically probable events; that is, these scoring streaks and slumps should be expected to regress to the mean over time and end naturally.\n",

    "Additionally, scoring runs may simply be a consequence of one team being better than the other. If you change the 50% conversions by both teams to 75% for one team and 25% for the other, the occurance of scoring runs drastically increases. I suggest that a timeout as a means to end a run may simply be a last-ditch effort to recover from a losing effort and may ultimately have no effect on the outcome of the game. In contrast, well-matched teams can expect regression to the mean despite momentary setbacks."
